== Chapter 1 - Basic Tagging

=== Chapter 1.1 - Inline Tagging

// PASSES
Before inline [#norm:inline]#inside inline# outside inline.

// SHOULD ALWAYS FAIL - Can't put inline tag at end of line.
Before bad inline [#norm:bad-inline-1]#
inside bad inline# outside bad inline.

// SHOULD ALWAYS FAIL - Can't span blocks (paragraphs in this case)
Before bad inline [#norm:bad-inline-2]#inside bad inline.

Next paragraph# outside.

// SHOULD ALWAYS FAIL - Can't span blocks (list in this case)
Before bad inline [#norm:bad-inline-3]#inside bad inline:

* Unordered list line 1#
* Unordered list line 2

=== Chapter 1.2 - Paragraph Tagging

// PASSES
[[norm:paragraph:no-inline-anchors]]
Paragraph without inline anchors

Next paragraph 1

// PASSES - Paragraph tag includes entire paragraph and inline tag just the inline portion.
[[norm:paragraph:inline-anchors:entire]]
Paragraph with [#norm:paragraph:inline-anchors:inline-anchor]#inline anchor# and something.

Next paragraph 2

// PASSES - Tag omits newline character
[[norm:paragraph:tag_with_newlines]]
Here's the first line.
Here's the second line.

// FAILS - Can't have multiple paragraph tags (only last works)
[[norm:abc]]
[[norm:def]]
This paragraph has two tags but we only ever get a tag for norm:def.

[[norm:abc]]
[[def]]
This paragraph has two tags but we'll never see either since the 1st isn't picked up by the tags backend as a tag and the second doesn't start with norm:

[[norm:formulae]]
This paragraph looks like a formulae to Excel because it has this < sign in it.
Make sure this gets written as a string, not a formulae in the XLSX or else it will create an error in Excel.

=== Chapter 2 - Table Tagging

// FAILS - Tag includes entire table but has adoc === prefixes/suffixes.
[[norm:table:no-anchors-in-cells:entire-table]]
[cols="1,1"]

|Cell in column 1, row 1 |Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 1, row 2 |Cell in column 2, row 2
|===

// FAILS - Tag includes entire table but has adoc === prefixes/suffixes.
[[norm:table:anchors-in-cells:entire-table]]
